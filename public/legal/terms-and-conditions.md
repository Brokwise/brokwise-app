## Welcome to Brokwise

Brokwise is a technology-driven B2B intermediary platform created with the purpose of enabling professional networking and opportunity facilitation within the real estate ecosystem. The Platform is designed to connect brokers with brokers, and developers with brokers, across geographical boundaries, thereby creating a unified digital space for professional networking and opportunity discovery.

Through Brokwise, brokers are empowered to:

- list and showcase properties and opportunities;
- share proposals and business requirements;
- make professional enquiries; and
- connect and collaborate with other brokers across India and internationally.

Similarly, Brokwise enables developers to showcase their approved and upcoming real estate projects to a network of brokers, facilitating professional engagement and potential business opportunities between developers and brokers.

These Terms of Use govern the access to and use of the Brokwise platform by brokers and outline the rules, responsibilities, and limitations applicable to broker-to-broker and developer-to-broker interactions facilitated through the Platform. This agreement is a legally binding contract between Brokwise Pvt. Ltd., its affiliates and subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to as "we", "us", or "our"), and you, being a broker using the Platform ("you", "your", or "Broker"). By accessing, registering on, or using the Brokwise Platform, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these Terms of Use, along with our [Platform Terms of Use](/platform-terms), [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy) and our other policies of our platform. If you do not agree with these Terms, you must not access or use the Platform.

Brokwise solely acts as a technology intermediary and does not act as a real estate broker, agent, consultant, or advisor. Any engagement, transaction, or arrangement arising between brokers or between developers and brokers through the Platform is undertaken independently by the concerned parties, without Brokwise being a party to or responsible for such arrangements.

By accessing or using the Platform in the capacity of a broker, you expressly acknowledge and agree that you shall be bound by both the Platform Terms and these Broker Terms of use, read together. In the event of any inconsistency or conflict between the Platform Terms and these Broker Terms, the Platform Terms of Use shall prevail and supersede to the extent of such conflict.

Brokwise does not verify, validate, or certify the legal status, regulatory approvals, RERA registration, title validity, ownership, or compliance status of any property, project, or listing made available on the Platform.

## 9. Subscription and Credit Usage

Access to and use of the Platform is subject to the Broker subscribing to one of the available activation/subscription plans, which may be offered on a monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, yearly or such other basis as determined by Brokwise from time to time. Each subscription plan entitles the Broker to a defined number of listings, enquiries, proposals and credits strictly in accordance with the features and limits of the selected plan. Upon exhaustion of the usage limits under a subscription plan, the Broker may purchase Credits bundle available on the platform or may utilise Credits available in their wallet to continue availing certain Platform features. Credits in the wallet can also be used, inter alia, for additional features on the platform such as featuring any listings, featuring any enquiries, marking listings or enquiries as urgent, and for bidding on enquiry proposals. Credits available in the Broker's wallet do not have any specified validity period and may be used so long as the Broker's subscription remains active and renewed. However, the user cannot use the available Credits in the wallet, without having any active subscription package in their account. Brokers acknowledge that featuring or prioritisation of listings, offers, or enquiries through the use of credits is dynamic and time-based. Placement at the top is determined by the date and time of credit utilisation, and any subsequent use of credits by any user may result in their listings, offers, or enquiries being displayed above earlier featured content. Brokwise does not guarantee continued top placement or visibility for any specific duration. Please note that subscription of the user and credits available in a Broker's account represent a limited, revocable license to access certain features of the Platform and do not constitute money, deposit, wallet balance, stored value, or any form of financial instrument; such subscription and credits are non-transferable, non-exchangeable, non-refundable, and cannot be redeemed or converted into money or any other form of value.
